Description: OpenERP-7 module: account_analytic_plans
  This module allows to use several analytic plans according to the general journal.
  ==================================================================================
  .
  Here multiple analytic lines are created when the invoice or the entries
  are confirmed.
  .
  For example, you can define the following analytic structure:
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  * **Projects**
  * Project 1
  + SubProj 1.1
  .
  + SubProj 1.2
  .
  * Project 2
  .
  * **Salesman**
  * Eric
  .
  * Fabien
  .
  Here, we have two plans: Projects and Salesman. An invoice line must be able to write analytic entries in the 2 plans: SubProj 1.1 and Fabien. The amount can also be split.
  .
  The following example is for an invoice that touches the two subprojects and assigned to one salesman:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  **Plan1:**
  .
  * SubProject 1.1 : 50%
  .
  * SubProject 1.2 : 50%
  .
  **Plan2:**
  Eric: 100%
  .
  So when this line of invoice will be confirmed, it will generate 3 analytic lines,for one account entry.
  .
  The analytic plan validates the minimum and maximum percentage at the time of creation of distribution models.

Description: OpenERP-7 module: account_anglo_saxon
  This module supports the Anglo-Saxon accounting methodology by changing the accounting logic with stock transactions.
  =====================================================================================================================
  .
  The difference between the Anglo-Saxon accounting countries and the Rhine
  (or also called Continental accounting) countries is the moment of taking
  the Cost of Goods Sold versus Cost of Sales. Anglo-Saxons accounting does
  take the cost when sales invoice is created, Continental accounting will
  take the cost at the moment the goods are shipped.
  .
  This module will add this functionality by using a interim account, to
  store the value of shipped goods and will contra book this interim
  account when the invoice is created to transfer this amount to the
  debtor or creditor account. Secondly, price differences between actual
  purchase price and fixed product standard price are booked on a separate
  account.

  Warning:
  ~~~~~~~~
  The confirmation of a payment order does _not_ create accounting entries, it just
  records the fact that you gave your payment order to your bank. The booking of
  your order must be encoded as usual through a bank statement. Indeed, it's only
  when you get the confirmation from your bank that your order has been accepted
  that you can book it in your accounting. To help you with that operation, you
  have a new option to import payment orders as bank statement lines.

  Add an extra Company dimension on Invoices for consolidated Invoice Analysis
  ============================================================================
  .
  By default Customer and Supplier invoices can be linked to a contact within
  a company, but the company is not a direct reference in the database structure for
  invoices. Journal Entries are however always linked to the company and not to
  contacts, so that Accounts Payable and Receivable are always correct and consolidated
  at company level.
  .
  When many different contacts/departments need to be invoiced within the same parent company,
  this can make reporting by Company more difficult: reports are directly based on the
  database structure and would not provide an aggregated company dimension.
  .
  This modules solves the problem by adding an explicit company reference on invoices,
  automatically computed from the invoice contact, and use this new dimension
  when grouping the list of Invoices or the Invoice Analysis report by Partner.
  .
  Note: this module will likely be removed for the next major OpenERP version and
  directly integrated in the core accounting.

  team. Once you get back your migrated database, you restore it and reverse the
  anonymization process to recover your previous data.

Description: OpenERP-7 module: auth_ldap
  Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.
  ===============================================
  This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
  will automatically create OpenERP users for them on the fly.
  .
  **Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.
  .
  Configuration:
  --------------
  After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
  Configuration tab of the Company details. Different companies may have different
  LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
  in OpenERP, even across multiple companies).
  .
  Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
  simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
  This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
  LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
  authenticate it.
  .
  Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
  it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.
  .
  For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
  manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.
  .
  Security Considerations:
  ------------------------
  Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the OpenERP database, the LDAP server
  is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
  password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.
  .
  OpenERP does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
  should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).
  .
  It is also possible to have local OpenERP users in the database along with
  LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).
  .
  Here is how it works:
  ---------------------
  * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local OpenERP
  database;
  * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
  password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;
  .
  As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local OpenERP database
  (which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
  queried to do the authentication.
  .
  Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
  encrypted.
  .
  User Template:
  --------------
  In the LDAP configuration on the Company form, it is possible to select a *User
  Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
  whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
  allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.
  .
  **Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
  assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
  a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
  usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
  login once with a valid LDAP user, let OpenERP create a blank local
  user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
  user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups
  the way you want.
  .
  Interaction with base_crypt:
  ----------------------------
  The base_crypt module is not compatible with this module, and will disable LDAP
  authentication if installed at the same time.

  New extensible file import for OpenERP
  ======================================

  client which duplicates the effort (between clients), makes the
  import system much harder to use without a client (direct RPC or
  other forms of automation) and makes knowledge about the
  import/export system much harder to gather as it is spread over
  3+ different projects.
  .
  * In a more extensible manner, so users and partners can build their
  own front-end to import from other file formats (e.g. OpenDocument
  files) which may be simpler to handle in their work flow or from
  their data production sources.
  .
  * In a module, so that administrators and users of OpenERP who do not
  need or want an online import can avoid it being available to users.

  VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
  =========================================
  .
  After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
  be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
  2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
  will be validated using the Belgian rules.
  .
  There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
  --------------------------------------------------------
  * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
  rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and
  always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
  or not valid anymore.
  .
  * When the "VAT VIES Check" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
  Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
  database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
  allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
  off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
  all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
  requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
  instead.
  .
  Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
  such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
  only the country code will be validated.

  The generic OpenERP Customer Relationship Management
  ====================================================
  .
  This application enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage leads, opportunities, meetings and phone calls.
  .
  It manages key tasks such as communication, identification, prioritization, assignment, resolution and notification.
  .
  OpenERP ensures that all cases are successfully tracked by users, customers and suppliers. It can automatically send reminders, escalate the request, trigger specific methods and many other actions based on your own enterprise rules.

  Email Templating (simplified version of the original Power Email by Openlabs).
  ==============================================================================
  .
  Lets you design complete email templates related to any OpenERP document (Sale
  Orders, Invoices and so on), including sender, recipient, subject, body (HTML and
  Text). You may also automatically attach files to your templates, or print and
  attach a report.
  .
  For advanced use, the templates may include dynamic attributes of the document
  they are related to. For example, you may use the name of a Partner's country
  when writing to them, also providing a safe default in case the attribute is
  not defined. Each template contains a built-in assistant to help with the
  inclusion of these dynamic values.
  .
  If you enable the option, a composition assistant will also appear in the sidebar
  of the OpenERP documents to which the template applies (e.g. Invoices).
  This serves as a quick way to send a new email based on the template, after
  reviewing and adapting the contents, if needed.
  This composition assistant will also turn into a mass mailing system when called
  for multiple documents at once.
  .
  These email templates are also at the heart of the marketing campaign system
  (see the ``marketing_campaign`` application), if you need to automate larger
  campaigns on any OpenERP document.
  .
  **Technical note:** only the templating system of the original Power Email by Openlabs was kept.

  Retrieve incoming email on POP/IMAP servers.
  ============================================
  .
  Enter the parameters of your POP/IMAP account(s), and any incoming emails on
  these accounts will be automatically downloaded into your OpenERP system. All
  POP3/IMAP-compatible servers are supported, included those that require an
  encrypted SSL/TLS connection.
  .
  This can be used to easily create email-based workflows for many email-enabled OpenERP documents, such as:
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * CRM Leads/Opportunities
  * CRM Claims
  * Project Issues
  * Project Tasks
  * Human Resource Recruitments (Applicants)
  .
  Just install the relevant application, and you can assign any of these document
  types (Leads, Project Issues) to your incoming email accounts. New emails will
  automatically spawn new documents of the chosen type, so it's a snap to create a
  mailbox-to-OpenERP integration. Even better: these documents directly act as mini
  conversations synchronized by email. You can reply from within OpenERP, and the
  answers will automatically be collected when they come back, and attached to the
  same *conversation* document.
  .
  For more specific needs, you may also assign custom-defined actions
  (technically: Server Actions) to be triggered for each incoming mail.

  Module to import CODA bank statements.
  ======================================
  .
  Supported are CODA flat files in V2 format from Belgian bank accounts.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * CODA v1 support.
  * CODA v2.2 support.
  * Foreign Currency support.
  * Support for all data record types (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).
  * Parsing & logging of all Transaction Codes and Structured Format
  Communications.
  * Automatic Financial Journal assignment via CODA configuration parameters.
  * Support for multiple Journals per Bank Account Number.
  * Support for multiple statements from different bank accounts in a single
  CODA file.
  * Support for 'parsing only' CODA Bank Accounts (defined as type='info' in
  the CODA Bank Account configuration records).
  * Multi-language CODA parsing, parsing configuration data provided for EN,
  NL, FR.
  .
  The machine readable CODA Files are parsed and stored in human readable format in
  CODA Bank Statements. Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of
  the CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the
  creation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a
  'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original
  CODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting
  business processes.
  .
  CODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.
  .
  A removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the
  associated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank
  Statements will also remove those associated statements.
  .
  The following reconciliation logic has been implemented in the CODA processing:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) The Company's Bank Account Number of the CODA statement is compared against
  the Bank Account Number field of the Company's CODA Bank Account
  configuration records (whereby bank accounts defined in type='info'
  configuration records are ignored). If this is the case an 'internal transfer'
  transaction is generated using the 'Internal Transfer Account' field of the
  CODA File Import wizard.
  2) As a second step the 'Structured Communication' field of the CODA transaction
  line is matched against the reference field of in- and outgoing invoices
  (supported : Belgian Structured Communication Type).
  3) When the previous step doesn't find a match, the transaction counterparty is
  located via the Bank Account Number configured on the OpenERP Customer and
  Supplier records.
  4) In case the previous steps are not successful, the transaction is generated
  by using the 'Default Account for Unrecognized Movement' field of the CODA
  File Import wizard in order to allow further manual processing.
  .
  In stead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also
  re-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that
  was missing to allow automatic reconciliation.
  .
  Remark on CODA V1 support:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured
  communication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The
  description provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA
  V2.2 specifications.
  If required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.

  Belgian localization for in- and outgoing invoices (prereq to account_coda):
  ============================================================================
  - Rename 'reference' field labels to 'Communication'
  - Add support for Belgian Structured Communication
  .
  A Structured Communication can be generated automatically on outgoing invoices according to the following algorithms:
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) Random : +++RRR/RRRR/RRRDD+++
  **R..R =** Random Digits, **DD =** Check Digits
  2) Date : +++DOY/YEAR/SSSDD+++
  **DOY =** Day of the Year, **SSS =** Sequence Number, **DD =** Check Digits
  3) Customer Reference +++RRR/RRRR/SSSDDD+++
  **R..R =** Customer Reference without non-numeric characters, **SSS =** Sequence Number, **DD =** Check Digits
  .
  The preferred type of Structured Communication and associated Algorithm can be
  specified on the Partner records. A 'random' Structured Communication will
  generated if no algorithm is specified on the Partner record.

  Base module for the Brazilian localization
  ==========================================
  .
  This module consists in:
  .
  - Generic Brazilian chart of accounts
  - Brazilian taxes such as:
  .
  - IPI
  - ICMS
  - PIS
  - COFINS
  - ISS
  - IR
  - IRPJ
  - CSLL
  .
  The field tax_discount has also been added in the account.tax.template and
  account.tax objects to allow the proper computation of some Brazilian VATs
  such as ICMS. The chart of account creation wizard has been extended to
  propagate those new data properly.
  .
  It's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to
  use OpenERP properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic
  fiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15
  additional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project
  https://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the
  extra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable
  OpenERP modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the
  reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization
  leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies
  fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers,
  accounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September
  2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't
  come with any additional paid permission for online use of 'private modules'.

  This is the module to manage the accounting chart for France in OpenERP.
  ========================================================================
  .
  This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
  companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).
  .
  This localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases
  (it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these
  'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
  module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
  scenarios in fiscal positions).
  .
  This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
  company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
  fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes
  and 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default
  in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
  configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

  This module lets users enter the banking details of Partners in the RIB format (French standard for bank accounts details).
  ===========================================================================================================================
  .
  RIB Bank Accounts can be entered in the "Accounting" tab of the Partner form by specifying the account type "RIB".
  .
  The four standard RIB fields will then become mandatory:
  --------------------------------------------------------
  - Bank Code
  - Office Code
  - Account number
  - RIB key
  .
  As a safety measure, OpenERP will check the RIB key whenever a RIB is saved, and
  will refuse to record the data if the key is incorrect. Please bear in mind that
  this can only happen when the user presses the 'save' button, for example on the
  Partner Form. Since each bank account may relate to a Bank, users may enter the
  RIB Bank Code in the Bank form - it will the pre-fill the Bank Code on the RIB
  when they select the Bank. To make this easier, this module will also let users
  find Banks using their RIB code.
  .
  The module base_iban can be a useful addition to this module, because French banks
  are now progressively adopting the international IBAN format instead of the RIB format.
  The RIB and IBAN codes for a single account can be entered by recording two Bank
  Accounts in OpenERP: the first with the type 'RIB', the second with the type 'IBAN'.

  When finishing/confirming, cancelling manufacturing orders set all state lines
  to the according state.
  .
  Create menus:
  -------------
  **Manufacturing** > **Manufacturing** > **Work Orders**
  .
  Which is a view on 'Work Orders' lines in manufacturing order.
  .
  Add buttons in the form view of manufacturing order under workorders tab:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * start (set state to confirm), set date_start
  * done (set state to done), set date_stop
  * set to draft (set state to draft)
  * cancel set state to cancel
  .
  When the manufacturing order becomes 'ready to produce', operations must
  become 'confirmed'. When the manufacturing order is done, all operations
  must become done.
  .
  The field 'Working Hours' is the delay(stop date - start date).
  So, that we can compare the theoretic delay and real delay.

  tab), then the new task will be created in that specific project. Otherwise, the
  new task will not belong to any project, and may be added to a project manually
  later.

Description: OpenERP-7 module: stock_location
  This module supplements the Warehouse application by effectively implementing Push and Pull inventory flows.
  ============================================================================================================
  .
  Typically this could be used to:
  --------------------------------
  * Manage product manufacturing chains
  * Manage default locations per product
  * Define routes within your warehouse according to business needs, such as:
  - Quality Control
  - After Sales Services
  - Supplier Returns
  .
  * Help rental management, by generating automated return moves for rented products
  .
  Once this module is installed, an additional tab appear on the product form,
  where you can add Push and Pull flow specifications. The demo data of CPU1
  product for that push/pull :
  .
  Push flows:
  -----------
  Push flows are useful when the arrival of certain products in a given location
  should always be followed by a corresponding move to another location, optionally
  after a certain delay. The original Warehouse application already supports such
  Push flow specifications on the Locations themselves, but these cannot be
  refined per-product.
  .
  A push flow specification indicates which location is chained with which location,
  and with what parameters. As soon as a given quantity of products is moved in the
  source location, a chained move is automatically foreseen according to the
  parameters set on the flow specification (destination location, delay, type of
  move, journal). The new move can be automatically processed, or require a manual
  confirmation, depending on the parameters.
  .
  Pull flows:
  -----------
  Pull flows are a bit different from Push flows, in the sense that they are not
  related to the processing of product moves, but rather to the processing of
  procurement orders. What is being pulled is a need, not directly products. A
  classical example of Pull flow is when you have an Outlet company, with a parent
  Company that is responsible for the supplies of the Outlet.
  .
  [ Customer ] <- A - [ Outlet ]  <- B -  [ Holding ] <~ C ~ [ Supplier ]
  .
  When a new procurement order (A, coming from the confirmation of a Sale Order
  for example) arrives in the Outlet, it is converted into another procurement
  (B, via a Pull flow of type 'move') requested from the Holding. When procurement
  order B is processed by the Holding company, and if the product is out of stock,
  it can be converted into a Purchase Order (C) from the Supplier (Pull flow of
  type Purchase). The result is that the procurement order, the need, is pushed
  all the way between the Customer and Supplier.
  .
  Technically, Pull flows allow to process procurement orders differently, not
  only depending on the product being considered, but also depending on which
  location holds the 'need' for that product (i.e. the destination location of
  that procurement order).
  .
  Use-Case:
  ---------
  .
  You can use the demo data as follow:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  **CPU1:** Sell some CPU1 from Chicago Shop and run the scheduler
  - Warehouse: delivery order, Chicago Shop: reception
  **CPU3:**
  - When receiving the product, it goes to Quality Control location then
  stored to shelf 2.
  - When delivering the customer: Pick List -> Packing -> Delivery Order from Gate A
